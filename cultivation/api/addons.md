### API Addons

New in Cultivation **0.5.0**.

[Events](/cultivation/api/events/) let you reshape what Cultivation does. [Registries](/cultivation/api/registries/) let you add content it treats as its own. The three hooks on this page go further: they let another mod **take over** a whole layer of Cultivation and keep everything else running on top.

| Hook: | Replaces: |
|:---|:---|
| [`ProgressionProvider`](#progressionprovider) | The entire realm / stage / Qi ladder. |
| [`CultivationTheme`](#cultivationtheme) | Every word the mod shows a player. |
| [`AdminConfigSection`](#adminconfigsection) | Nothing -- it *adds* your own settings to Cultivation's admin menus. |

All three are installed from your plugin's `setup()`, in any load order relative to Cultivation's own. Nothing reads them until a player meditates, opens a menu, or trips a realm gate, which is long after every plugin has loaded.

<br/>

#### ProgressionProvider

```java
CultivationAPI.setProgressionProvider(@Nullable ProgressionProvider provider)
CultivationAPI.getProgressionProvider()
```

Hands your mod the realm/stage/Qi ladder. From the moment one is installed, every command, UI page, HUD line and gameplay gate in Cultivation reads its numbers from you instead of from the player's `CultivationComponent`: `/cultivation` shows your rank names, the HUD shows your XP bar, the meditation ritual runs your rank-ups.

**Everything else in the mod keeps working.** [Sects](/cultivation/sects/), [the Dao](/cultivation/dao/), [techniques](/cultivation/techniques/), [spirit beasts](/cultivation/beasts/), [formations](/cultivation/formations/), [cave abodes](/cultivation/dwelling/), [duels](/cultivation/duels/), [alchemy](/cultivation/alchemy/), [refinement](/cultivation/refinement/) and the [skill tree](/cultivation/skilltree/) all sit on top of whatever ladder is installed.

##### Realm gates

Dozens of gates across the mod are written against `CultivationRealm` -- a technique's unlock realm, a race's, a spirit beast species' minimum realm, refinement tiers, abode quality, the Dao unlock. Rather than rewrite them, Cultivation asks your provider which realm the player **counts as**:

```java
@Nonnull CultivationRealm getEquivalentRealm(ComponentAccessor<EntityStore> accessor, Ref<EntityStore> ref);
```

Map your own levels onto the seven realms however you like, and every existing gate understands your progression for free.

##### Two kinds of rank-up

Cultivation drives rank-ups through its timed meditation ritual and offers two flavours. Map your progression onto them however suits:

| Flavour: | Ritual: |
|:---|:---|
| **Advancement** | The routine step. Shorter, lower Spirit Vein requirement, no [tribulation](/cultivation/tribulations/) lightning by default. |
| **Breakthrough** | The milestone step. Longer, higher vein requirement, tribulation lightning -- or the Heart-Devil Trial for a deeply-leaned cultivator. |

Only one may be ready at a time; `isReadyForBreakthrough` is tested first. Returning true from neither simply means meditation does its ordinary thing that tick. You also supply the ritual durations yourself through `getBreakthroughDurationSeconds` and `getAdvancementDurationSeconds`, so the [built-in timings](/cultivation/realms/) do not apply to your ladder.

##### What you store

The interface is deliberately **stateless** -- every method is handed the accessor and ref of the player being asked about, so your own persisted component stays the single source of truth. The player's `CultivationComponent` still exists and is left completely alone, which is what lets a server uninstall your addon and get its original realms back untouched.

> **Threading.** Every method is called on that player's world thread, and the accessor may be a `CommandBuffer` rather than a `Store`. Component **creation** must go through the accessor, not `ref.getStore().putComponent` -- the latter throws *"Store is currently processing!"* and takes the world down. Reads are fine either way.

Only one provider can be installed at a time. The last to register wins, and a warning naming both is logged, since two mods each believing they own progression is a misconfiguration rather than something to silently pick a winner for. Pass `null` to hand progression back to the built-in system.

<br/>

#### CultivationTheme

```java
CultivationAPI.setTheme(@Nullable CultivationTheme theme)
CultivationAPI.getTheme()
```

Re-words the mod's entire player-facing vocabulary without touching its behaviour, so a setting with soul masters and academies rather than cultivators and sects reads as its own game instead of a re-skin. Every string Cultivation shows a player -- chat, commands, HUD, menus, item names, tooltips -- is routed through your `translate` first, and whatever you return is used verbatim.

```java
@Nullable Message translate(@Nonnull String key);
```

Return `null` for any key you do not re-word and Cultivation's own wording is used, so a theme may cover as much or as little as it likes.

##### Why a hook and not a language file

Because the engine will not let you do it with one. Language files from every asset pack are merged into a single catalog, and that merge is **first-writer-wins** -- a duplicate key from a later pack is discarded and logged as `'x' has multiple definitions`. Cultivation's own pack loads before any addon that depends on it, so an addon shipping `server.cultivation.playerMsg.breakthrough` in its own `server.lang` would be silently ignored, and even winning that race would only mean winning it on that particular boot.

So a theme keeps its strings under **its own keys** -- which collide with nothing -- and maps Cultivation's keys onto them.

> Return a `Message.translation(...)` of your own key rather than `Message.raw(...)` wherever you can. Raw text is identical in every language, and Cultivation is translated.

`translate` is called on whatever thread is building the message, often several times per rendered line, so it must be fast, thread-safe and free of side effects -- a lookup in an immutable map is the intended shape. Any `.param(...)` placeholders Cultivation fills in are applied to whatever you return, so a replacement must keep the same placeholder names; drop one and it renders empty.

<br/>

<br/>

#### AdminConfigSection

```java
CultivationAPI.registerAdminConfigSection(@Nonnull AdminConfigSection section)
CultivationAPI.unregisterAdminConfigSection(@Nonnull String sectionKey)
CultivationAPI.getAdminConfigSections()
CultivationAPI.newAdminConfigField(String key, Message label, ...)
```

Adds a group of tunable numbers to Cultivation's admin menu, where it appears as its own section button on the Config tab of `/cultivation admin` beside Cultivation's own nine -- with the same rows, the same editing, and the same single Save. The same settings also appear in a **Mod Settings** block at the bottom of the ordinary Cultivation settings menu, visible to admins only.

One section per config file is the shape Cultivation uses for itself and the one that reads best.

| Member: | Purpose: |
|:---|:---|
| `getKey()` | A stable id, unique across every registered section. Namespace it (`"SoulRings:spiritPower"`). What a click on the button sends back, so it is deliberately independent of list order. |
| `getLabel()` | The section button and heading. Use a `Message.translation(...)` so it localizes. |
| `getHint()` | One line explaining what the section tunes -- the button tooltip and the text under the heading. |
| `getFields()` | The rows, in display order. Build them with `newAdminConfigField` rather than implementing `AdminConfigField` yourself. |
| `save()` | Persists the section after an admin presses Save. |

Only **numbers** are supported, because the row widget behind it is a number input. Express a boolean as a 0/1 field with a label saying so, and keep anything list-shaped in the config file -- Cultivation makes the same call for its own booleans and its Qi-absorption item table.

Both host pages are gated on `cultivation.admin`, and the gate is re-checked server-side on save rather than trusted from the menu, so a section may safely expose real balance numbers.

> Return a **stable** field list. The page matches an admin's in-flight edits to fields by key, so a list that changes shape between render and save silently drops those edits. Clamp out-of-range values in the field's `set` -- the page re-displays whatever `get` returns afterwards, so a coerced value is shown back to the admin rather than silently disagreeing with what they typed.

Registering the same section key twice replaces the first, so this is safe across a reload of your plugin.

#### Reading a player under any ladder

Three facade methods report a cultivator's standing under whichever system happens to be live, so your code does not need to know whether a provider is installed:

| Method: | Returns: |
|:---|:---|
| `CultivationAPI.getGlobalLevel(accessor, ref)` | The installed provider's level, or the built-in realm/stage flattened into one ever-increasing number. |
| `CultivationAPI.getQi(accessor, ref)` | Banked progress toward the next rank-up -- the provider's progress if one is installed, else banked Qi. |
| `CultivationAPI.refreshProgression(accessor, ref)` | Re-reads the provider's view of a player, after your own mod changes their level outside a rank-up. |

`CultivationAPI.getRealm(accessor, ref)` returns the **effective** realm, which is the provider's equivalent realm while one is installed -- this is what every gate in the mod tests against. `CultivationAPI.getStage(accessor, ref)` is always `null` under a provider, since a replacement ladder has no sub-stages -- it has only its own `getSubRankLabel`. Prefer `getGlobalLevel` for anything numeric.

The [rankings](/cultivation/realms/) and `/cultivation top` sort on that flattened level, so a replacement progression ranks correctly against itself. For the built-in ladder the ordering is exactly what realm-then-stage always produced.
