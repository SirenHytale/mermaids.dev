### Formations

A **Formation (阵法)** is a spirit array inscribed into the ground, anchored to one chunk and reaching out over the chunks around it. There are three kinds: one that feeds your own cultivation, one that starves everyone else's, and one that hurts anybody who walks in uninvited. They are how a [Sect] turns a claimed mountain into ground that actually defends itself.

The whole system is gated behind `Formations-Enabled` (default `true`).

#### The Three Arrays

| Array: | Radius: | Effect: |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Spirit-Gathering Array** (聚灵阵) | 2 chunks (`QiGathering-Radius-Chunks`) | Multiplies meditation Qi regen by **1.4x** (`QiGathering-Regen-Multiplier`) for its controllers meditating in range. |
| **Mountain-Guarding Array** (护山大阵) | 2 chunks (`Warding-Radius-Chunks`) | Multiplies meditation Qi regen by **0.25x** (`Warding-Outsider-Regen-Multiplier`) for outsiders meditating in range. Controllers are unaffected. |
| **Immortal-Binding Array** (困仙阵) | 1 chunk (`Trapping-Radius-Chunks`) | Roots and wounds intruders caught inside it. |

Radius is square (Chebyshev), measured in chunks from the anchor - so radius 2 covers a 5x5 block of chunks, and radius 1 a 3x3.

By default a Spirit-Gathering Array only feeds its own controllers. Set `QiGathering-Benefits-Everyone` to `true` to make it a public good that helps any meditator in range.

A Mountain-Guarding Array does more than choke Qi: outsiders also cannot inscribe their own formations on warded ground, and cannot claim a [Cave Abode] there.

**The Immortal-Binding Array's trap**, every **3 seconds** (`Trapping-Interval-Seconds`), does the following to every intruder standing inside it:

- Deals **4% of their max health** (`Trapping-Damage-Percent-Of-Max-Health`) through the normal damage pipeline, so armour and the mod's own damage reductions apply.
- Applies the `Root` entity effect for **2.5 seconds** (`Trapping-Debuff-Effect` / `Trapping-Debuff-Duration-Seconds`). Blank the effect id to skip the debuff and keep only the damage.
- Never kills. `Trapping-Lethal` is `false` by default, so a trap tick always leaves at least a sliver of health - the intruder has to flee its bounds, not respawn. Set it `true` to let a trap finish off a persistent trespasser.

Controllers walk through their own trap freely.

#### Who Controls a Formation

Control follows a single rule: **your sect if you are in one, otherwise you personally.**

- Placed by a sect member, the array is controlled by the sect, and every member of that sect is a beneficiary.
- Placed by a soloist, it is controlled by their UUID alone.

Membership is resolved live, so joining or leaving a sect immediately changes who benefits from - and who is an outsider to - that sect's arrays, without touching the stored formation. Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Renaming a sect** carries its formations with it (see [Sects]), so a sect never ends up warded and trapped by its own arrays.
- **Disbanding a sect** disperses every array it controlled. Left behind they would match no living sect, making everyone an outsider forever, with nobody able to remove them.

#### Placing and Removing

Each array has its own **Formation Flag** item. Use the flag while standing in the chunk you want as the anchor.

| Flag item: | Places: | Crafted from: |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Spirit-Gathering Array Flag | 聚灵阵 | 1 Profound Core + 1 Spirit Core |
| Mountain-Guarding Array Flag | 护山大阵 | 1 Divine Core + 1 Profound Core |
| Immortal-Binding Array Flag | 困仙阵 | 2 Divine Cores |

See [Qi Gathering] for where cultivation cores come from. None of the three flags drops on death.

The flag is a **toggle**. Using it on a chunk where you already control an array of that same type **removes** it instead of placing a second one. Otherwise:

- The flag is consumed only on a successful placement - a refusal costs you nothing.
- Placement is refused if another controller already holds an array of that type on that exact chunk.
- Placement is refused on ground warded against you, whether by someone else's Mountain-Guarding Array or by a sustained [Cave Abode].
- Placement is refused once you are at your cap: **3 formations per controller** (`Max-Formations-Per-Controller`). The cap is per controller, so a whole sect shares three between them.

`/cultivation formations` (aliases `formation`, `arrays`) lists every array you control - type, world, anchor chunk and radius, newest first - so you can walk back to one and disperse it.

<br/>

#### Overlap and Stacking

Only an *exact-chunk duplicate of the same type* is refused, so arrays on neighbouring chunks overlap freely. To keep that from compounding, **each type applies at most once** however many arrays of that type cover the chunk you are standing on. Three Mountain-Guarding arrays laid side by side choke an outsider at 0.25x, not 0.25x cubed.

Different types do combine: an outsider meditating inside both a Spirit-Gathering array that benefits everyone and a Mountain-Guarding array gets 1.4 x 0.25.

A [Cave Abode]'s own meditation multipliers are applied separately from this, on top.

#### Commands

| Command: | Description: | Permission: |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `/cultivation formations` | Lists every formation you control, with its anchor chunk and radius. | `cultivation` |

Placement and removal have no command - they are done entirely with the flag items.

Every value on this page lives in the society config - see [Society Config] for the full field reference, and [Commands] for every command in the mod. Formations interlock with [Sects], defend a hall during [Sect Wars], and share their warding rules with [Cave Abodes].
