### Cave Abodes

A **Cave Abode (洞府)** is a pocket of ground a cultivator claims as their own. Inside it, meditation goes further, outsiders are pushed back, and a **Spirit Spring (灵泉)** slowly gathers Qi for you whether or not you are logged in - as long as you keep feeding the place. It is the mod's answer to "what do I do with the hours I am not playing".

The whole system is gated behind `Dwellings-Enabled` (default `true`).

#### Claiming an Abode

`/cultivation abode claim` claims the chunk you are standing in as the heart of your abode.

- The abode covers **1 chunk in every direction** (`Dwelling-Radius-Chunks`), a 3x3 pocket of chunks.
- **One abode per cultivator.** Claiming again simply moves it, and moving keeps your banked spring and paid upkeep - relocating a home should not cost you what you stored in it.
- You cannot claim ground already covered by another abode or by a sect hall's spring, including your own sect's - a hall already gathers there, and stacking a personal spring on it would double-dip the same chunk.
- You cannot claim ground warded against you by someone else's Mountain-Guarding [Formation].
- Any Spirit Vein tier will do, but the vein under your claim decides how fast the spring fills.

`/cultivation abode abandon` gives the claim up outright - and the banked spring is lost with it, immediately, with no confirmation step.

While an abode is **sustained** (its upkeep is paid), it changes meditation on its ground:

| Meditating inside an abode: | Qi regen multiplier: | Config key: |
|:---|:---|:---|
| You, in your own abode (or a member in their sect's hall) | **1.25x** | `Dwelling-Owner-Regen-Multiplier` |
| Anyone else | **0.5x** | `Dwelling-Outsider-Regen-Multiplier` |

Outsiders also cannot inscribe [Formations] on a sustained abode's ground. A lapsed abode is just an empty cave until its owner feeds it again - no multipliers, no ward.

#### The Spirit Spring

Nothing about the spring ticks. Its contents are worked out from wall-clock elapsed time whenever anyone touches the abode, which is exactly why offline accrual works at all: you can be logged out for a week with the chunk unloaded, and the spring still holds precisely what it should.

- Base rate: **60 Qi per real-world hour** (`Spring-Qi-Per-Hour`).
- **x1.5** on a rich Spirit Vein (`Spring-Rich-Vein-Multiplier`), **x2.5** on a dragon vein (`Spring-Dragon-Vein-Multiplier`).
- Pool cap: **500 + 250 per realm** you have reached (`Spring-Pool-Base-Cap` / `Spring-Pool-Cap-Per-Realm`). An abandoned abode overflows and wastes whatever it gathers past the cap. Your realm is re-read onto the abode whenever you visit it, since an offline owner's realm cannot be read.
- The spring only fills for hours your **upkeep actually covered**. Feeding a neglected abode does not retroactively fill it.

`/cultivation abode collect` (alias `drink`) drinks the spring dry and banks the whole pool into your own Qi. You must be **standing inside the abode** - the spring is a place, not an allowance.

#### Upkeep and Spirit Stones

An abode has to be fed. `/cultivation abode deposit` (alias `offer`), run standing inside it, offers up the **entire stack in your hand**; each item is worth the hours listed for it in `Upkeep-Item-Hours`.

| Tribute item: | Hours of sustenance each: |
|:---|:---|
| Spirit Stone | 24 |
| Divine Core | 36 |
| Profound Core | 12 |
| Spirit Core | 4 |
| Qi Gathering Pill | 6 |
| Clarity Pill | 6 |
| Tribulation Ward Pill | 8 |
| Clear-Mind Pill | 8 |

Anything not on that list is refused as tribute, so a server owner can add their own currency simply by naming it in the config.

**Spirit Stones** are the intended currency - a crystallized shard of ambient Qi, and nothing else in the mod consumes them. Two sources:

- **4%** chance on slaying a creature (`SpiritStone-Kill-Drop-Chance`), rolled independently of the cultivation-core roll, so one kill can yield both.
- **35%** chance for **surviving** a tribulation strike (`SpiritStone-Tribulation-Drop-Chance`) - the heavens' lightning crystallizes the Qi it scatters. See [Tribulations].

Burning a Divine Core on rent is meant to sting; the cores are accepted at a deliberately worse rate than stones.

The upkeep timeline:

- A newly claimed abode starts with **0 free hours** (`Upkeep-Initial-Free-Hours`) - its spring stays dry until you first feed it. That is deliberate: any grant here is handed out again on every new claim, so a generous value would let players abandon and re-claim to dwell for free.
- No abode may bank more than **720 hours** at once (`Upkeep-Max-Banked-Hours`). A deposit that would exceed the ceiling is capped; a deposit into an already-full abode is refused outright rather than swallowing your stack for nothing.
- When upkeep runs out the spring **stops gathering immediately** and the abode's multipliers and ward switch off.
- After a further **168 hours** of grace (`Upkeep-Grace-Hours`) a personal claim is **released entirely** and everything banked in it is lost.

Set `Upkeep-Enabled` to `false` to make abodes permanent and free.

#### Sect Hall Springs

With `Sect-Hall-Spring-Enabled` on (the default), a [Sect]'s claimed hall grows a **shared** Spirit Spring of its own, on top of every member's personal abode:

- It gathers at **1.5x** the personal rate (`Sect-Spring-Rate-Multiplier`) into a pool **2x** as deep (`Sect-Spring-Pool-Cap-Multiplier`).
- Its pool cap scales with the **highest realm** among its members, read live, so a hall full of high-realm cultivators holds far more than one claimed on day one.
- **Any member** may collect it by standing in the hall and running `/cultivation abode collect`. First one there takes the lot, so it rewards showing up.
- It takes upkeep exactly like a personal abode, and any member standing in the hall can deposit tribute.
- It follows the hall: moving the hall moves the spring, and **losing the hall in a siege hands the spring, and everything banked in it, to the victor**. See [Sect Wars].
- A neglected sect spring is never released the way a personal claim is - it belongs to the hall, so it merely stops gathering until fed.
- A hall claimed on top of somebody's existing abode does not grow a second spring over the same ground; the sect gets its spring on a later sweep, once whoever is dwelling there has moved on.

#### Closed-Door Seclusion

**Seclusion (闭关)** is what happens if you begin meditating inside your own abode - or your sect's hall - and then log out. You keep cultivating while you are away.

- You gather **25 Qi per real-world hour** offline (`Seclusion-Qi-Per-Hour`), credited the moment you next log in.
- At most **24 hours** of any single absence counts (`Seclusion-Max-Hours`).
- The abode's upkeep must be paid both when you leave and when you return.
- By default the Qi is **drawn from the abode's Spirit Spring** rather than conjured (`Seclusion-Drains-Spring`), so seclusion and `/cultivation abode collect` compete for one reserve and an abode can never pay twice for the same hours. A dry spring pays a retreat nothing. Turn it off to let seclusion generate Qi independently.
- Come back to an abode that is no longer yours or no longer fed - upkeep lapsed, the hall taken in a siege, the sect left - and the retreat is forfeit. The cave stopped sustaining you.

It is deliberately far slower than sitting there awake. Seclusion exists so a cultivator who cannot spend forty minutes meditating still advances, not as a better way to cultivate. Set `Seclusion-Enabled` to `false` to switch it off entirely.
