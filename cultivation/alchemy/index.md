### Alchemy

Alchemy turns [cultivation cores](/cultivation/qi-gathering/) into **spirit pills** - consumable one-shot advantages that make a stretch of cultivating, or a single dangerous ritual, go your way. Four ship with the mod. Each has its own recipe, and each is consumed on use.

#### The Pills

| Pill: | Quality: | Recipe: | Effect: |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Qi Gathering Pill** | Rare | 2x Spirit Core | Multiplies **all** Qi you gather by `QiPill-Gain-Multiplier` (1.5) for `QiPill-Duration-Seconds` (300). |
| **Clarity Pill** | Rare | 1x Profound Core + 1x Spirit Core | Multiplies ritual durations by `ClarityPill-Ritual-Speed-Multiplier` (0.75) for `ClarityPill-Duration-Seconds` (300). |
| **Tribulation Ward Pill** | Epic | 1x Divine Core + 1x Lightning Essence | Banks `WardPill-Shield-Charges` (1) charge, up to `WardPill-Max-Stored-Charges` (3). |
| **Clear-Mind Pill** | Epic | 1x Divine Core + 1x Profound Core | Banks `ClearMindPill-Charges` (1) charge, up to `ClearMindPill-Max-Stored-Charges` (3). |

#### Qi Gathering Pill

Applies to every source of cultivation Qi - meditation drain and absorbed cores alike - for five minutes. Re-consuming refreshes the timer rather than stacking a second copy. It multiplies alongside your [race](/cultivation/races/) bonus, your [skill tree's](/cultivation/skilltree/) Insight branch, and everything else that touches Qi gain.

#### Clarity Pill

Multiplies the duration of a breakthrough, an advancement or a [refinement](/cultivation/refinement/) ritual by 0.75 - a quarter faster - for five minutes. It stacks **multiplicatively** with the race and skill-tree ritual-speed bonuses, and the same 90% floor that clamps those applies to the total.

Shorter rituals also mean fewer tribulation bolts, since bolts fall on a fixed interval of ritual progress.

#### Tribulation Ward Pill

A banked charge **fully negates the damage of one tribulation lightning strike**. The bolt still falls, with all its noise and light - it simply does not hurt you. Charges persist until they are spent, so you can bank up to three before a dangerous breakthrough and walk into it knowing the first three bolts are free.

This is the direct counter to a heavy [karma](/cultivation/karma/) ledger, and the reason a Divine Core is worth holding onto rather than absorbing.

#### Clear-Mind Pill

The Heart-Devil Trial's answer to the Ward Pill. A banked charge holds your composure through **one pulse** of the trial - the inner demon still appears, but that pulse drains no composure at all. Charges persist until used, up to three at a time.

A deeply Yin- or Yang-leaned cultivator faces the Heart-Devil Trial instead of lightning, so a Ward Pill does them no good and a Clear-Mind Pill is the only ward that helps. See [Tribulations](/cultivation/tribulations/).

#### Notes

- Pills are recipes on the items themselves, so they are crafted the same way any other recipe in the game is.
- None of the four drop on death.
- All four are also valid [spirit beast](/cultivation/beasts/) food, worth 25 Qi each when fed - a considerably worse use of a Divine Core than eating the pill yourself.

Every duration, multiplier and charge count lives in the alchemy config - see [Config](/cultivation/config/arts/) - and the related commands are on the [Commands](/cultivation/commands/) page.
